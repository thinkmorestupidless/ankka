- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- Validated 2026-09-28. The one decision with weight — how organizations that predate the feature
  are counted — is taken as an assumption (projects backfilled, services counted on next apply)
  rather than a marker, because the plan can revisit it and it changes no request's outcome for a
  new organization.
